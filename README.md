# Exploration of Inherited Enzymatic Deficiency by Perturbation of Reconstructed RBC Model

   In this project, the RBC MASS model was used to study three case studies related to three pathological deficiencies: the PGI deficiency, PGK deficiency and GND deficiency. Those deficiencies are caused by mutation in part of the chromosome, and have a large effect on some specific populations. The RBC model contains four subsystems: glycolysis, pentose phosphate pathway(PPP), AMP metabolism, and hemoglobin modules. The merging of these subsystems alongside with the enzyme module provides insights of how the deficiencies impact the system as a whole. In the PGI case study, decrease of PGI forward rate was utilized to represent PGI deficiency, and the influence towards G6PDH2r and HEX1 was explored. In the PGK case study, the perturbation of increase and decrease ATP utilizations were made by increasing and decreasing the rate constant of the ADK1 enzyme, and their effects on healthy and PGK deficiency models were examined. In the GND case study, we examined the relationship between GND deficiency and G6PDH2r deficiency by comparing two mutated models under GSH utilization perturbation. We hope the case studies can provide insights for the treatment of inherited enzyme deficiency.
